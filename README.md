# [Demand Planning and Inventory Management Project](https://github.com/Abhi-c52/Abhi-s-Analytics-Repository/tree/525d0c38999c7f99f689ccf03446158712a025ae/Excel%20Project-%20Demand%20Planning%20and%20Inventory%20Management)
This project analyzes inventory control strategies and demand data to optimize costs and improve efficiency. Key highlights include:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

- Addressed missing values, outliers, and sporadic demand patterns.
2. Data Aggregation:

Evaluated the need for aggregation (weekly, monthly, etc.) and optimized based on demand trends.
Autocorrelation Analysis:

Computed and analyzed autocorrelation functions (ACF) for demand time series using Excel and Wessa.net.
Forecasting:

Predicted next year's demand using SOFT methods and ARIMA models.
Compared results from Excel and Wessa.net for validation.
Inventory Optimization:

Determined optimal parameters for [t, q] and [s, q] inventory control strategies.
Considered lead time, demand variability, and cost minimization.
Strategy Comparison:

Compared current and proposed inventory strategies based on historical and forecasted data.
Documentation:

Detailed results, calculations, and charts provided in both Excel and PDF formats.
