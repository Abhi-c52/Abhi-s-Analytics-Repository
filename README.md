# [Demand Planning and Inventory Management Project](https://github.com/Abhi-c52/Abhi-s-Analytics-Repository/tree/525d0c38999c7f99f689ccf03446158712a025ae/Excel%20Project-%20Demand%20Planning%20and%20Inventory%20Management)
This project analyzes inventory control strategies and demand data to optimize costs and improve efficiency. Key highlights include:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

  - Addressed missing values, outliers, and sporadic demand patterns. Cleaned data using two filters.
2. Data Aggregation:

  - Performed Quarterly, Monthly, Weekly as well as Yearly Aggregation with Pivot Tables.
3. Autocorrelation Analysis:

- Computed and analyzed autocorrelation functions (ACF) for demand time series using Excel and Wessa.net.
4. Forecasting:

- Predicted next year's demand using SOFT methods like: Moving Average, Weighted Moving Average, Linear Regressing, HOLT and ARIMA models such as ARIMA(1,0,1), ARIMA(1,1,1), ARIMA(2,2,1). 
- Compared results from Excel and Wessa.net for validation.
- Determined Errors such as: MSE, RMSE, MAE, MdAE, MAPE, MdAPE, RMSPE, RMdSPE

5. Inventory Optimization:

- Determined optimal parameters for [t, q] and [s, q] inventory control strategies.
- Considered lead time, demand variability, and cost minimization.
6. Strategy Comparison:

- Compared current and proposed inventory strategies based on historical and forecasted data.
Documentation:

7. Detailed results, calculations, and charts provided in both Excel and PDF formats.

# [ABC and XYZ Analysis](https://github.com/Abhi-c52/Abhi-s-Analytics-Repository/tree/8cb76c4e1c118372f3bc4d46e491add8a5bc1638/Excel-%20ABC%20and%20XYZ%20Analysis)

1. ABC Analysis:

- Monthly classification of products in 2022 using Pareto principles.
- Final weighted category assigned for each product (A = 4, B = 2, C = 1).
2. XYZ Analysis:

- Weekly demand variability categorized as X (low), Y (moderate), Z (high).
- Advanced analyses (tXYZ, RXYZ) for sporadic demand patterns.
3. Consolidated Results:

- Combined ABC-XYZ classifications summarized in a table.
4. Excel functions used: OFFSET, MATCH, INDEX, SUMPRODUCT, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP.
